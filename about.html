          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            After working in the fashion industry for more than 8 years in sales, management,
            and product development I decided it was time for a change.
            <br>
            <br>
            After a lot of reflection I realized what was really important to me was a job
            that was fulfilling, and provided a flexible life. I started studying some front-end
            technologies in February of 2022, and realized I'd found what I was looking for.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started studying with SheCodes learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I built
            some great projects including two weather apps, one using vanilla JavaScript,
            and the other using React, as well as the start of this portfolio site.
            <br>
            <br>
            Eventually I felt that the next step for me would be a bootcamp. Living in NYC at the
            time I looked there first but I eventually decided to widen my search to bootcamps around
            the world. Then I found Le Wagon, from there I did my research and settled on Berlin.
            Part of the joy for me in doing this bootcamp meant the ability to truly learn to work in
            team settings while coding. I was very lucky to work with people from all over the world.
            The program focused on fullstack on a Rails framwework. Within that Ruby, HTML, CSS/SCSS,
            JavaScript, React, and Stimulus. I created two group projects with my team in Rails. One app
            was a psuedo product exchange app (BookMe), the other a safety focused travel app for women
            (SafeTravels). Check out what I've been working on!
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="work.html">Check out what I've been working on!</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm enjoying continuing to learn and grow as a front-end developer.
